      <description>Spam detection is one of the major applications of Machine Learning in the interwebs today. Pretty much all of the major email service providers have spam detection systems built in and automatically classify such mail as &amp;lsquo;Junk Mail&amp;rsquo;.
  In this mission I will be using the Naive Bayes algorithm to create a model that can classify SMS messages as spam or not spam, based on the training I give to the model.</description>

      <description>Whether or not you like football, the Super Bowl is a spectacle. There&amp;rsquo;s a little something for everyone at your Super Bowl party. Drama in the form of blowouts, comebacks, and controversy for the sports fan. There are the ridiculously expensive ads, some hilarious, others gut-wrenching, thought-provoking, and weird. The half-time shows with the biggest musicians in the world, sometimes riding giant mechanical tigers or leaping from the roof of the stadium.</description>
